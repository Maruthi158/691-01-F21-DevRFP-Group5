## Statement of Purpose :

 We intend to build a native web application that would be a solo place where students would be able to track the upcoming assignments, class tasks in an easy way . This tool allows students to even check for updates in the calendar about upcoming to-do lists, memo functionality. This tool will also provide the flexibility for the students to customize the look of the application based on their own choice of themes. The chat option inside the application would ease the communication between students and professors. 
The main purpose of this application is to help students build knowledge towards the course being a platform for having all the information at the same place. Also for the preparation of examination and future purposes, the data that is available in this application helps.
 
 
 ## Overview of Project :
 
 We would like to create a native web application in which upon clicking the application we will be re-directed to the screen where it will display two options sign up and sign in. If we have new students who are trying to use this application for the first time, they need to create the profile newly by clicking sign up. Existing students can log in using the sign-in option.

The existing student users can log in with a user id and password, we will include the two-factor authentication with User id and mobile number. For mobile number authentication we will receive a verification code to our mobile after entering the phone number.

Students can view courses they registered for, to-do list, memo functionality which will encourage them to complete a task on time.

We are providing the chat option inside the application so that students can interact with the Professors as well as students.

We are providing additional options for students to customize their own choice of themes according to their choice.

## Technology stack descriptions:

Below are the details for stack:

1)**Backend language + framework :** The backend language & framework  for this project would be  **JavaScript / Node.js**


2)**Backend app host :** The backend app host would be **Heroku**


3)**Data host + type :** The Data host and type for this project would be  **Atlas MongoDB**


4)**Front-end page plan :** The Front-end page plan would be single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.
