## Statement of Purpose :

 We have many applications like a canvas which would help students to view their courses, submit their assignments, view their grades. But this project Bearcat Study Buddy will be helpful for students to track their upcoming assignments,  helps in establishing strong communication between students and professors.
 
 
 ## Overview of Project :
 The overview of the project is to develop a web application that allows students to track their upcoming assignments or events related to a  specific Course.
 
* At first, we would have a login page where an existing user can log in or a new user can create an account.
* After they have created an account with their desired userID and password. They can upload their schedule.
* They can view courses they registered for, the to-do list, memo functionality of the assignments which will encourage them to complete a task on time.
* They would be provided with a chat option to ease the communication between students and professors.
* The users would be provided an option to customize the look of the application based on their choice.


## Benefits :

* This application would provide a single snapshot of the calendar to check the deadlines of upcoming tasks.
* This application would provide a feature with a memo functionality option which would help users to know about the details of the upcoming assignments.
* This application would provide a chat option to students to allow the interaction between students and professors.
* This application will provide a flexibility for users to customize the look of the application according to their choice as they would have better visualization

## Stack description:

Below are the details for stack:

1)**Backend language + framework :** The backend language & framework  for this project would be  **JavaScript / Node.js**


2)**Backend app host :** The backend app host would be **Heroku**


3)**Data host + type :** The Data host and type for this project would be  **Atlas MongoDB**


4)**Front-end page plan :** The Front-end page plan would be single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.


5)**Front-end responsive design :** The Front end responsive design would be **Bootstrap.**


6)**Static analysis tools :** The static analysis tools  used for this project is **Snyk.**


## Risks and assumptions:

* Student User should upload the schedule correctly by using a proper file format.
* The authentication must be properly done based on the data stored in the database.


## Deliverable artifacts:


## Scope:
We are building a web application that would have the following features like display the upcoming to-do lists on the home page of the application with memo functionality feature. The application would also provide a calendar option to view all the assignment's due dates in an organized and  Visualized way. The chat option inside the application would allow the communication between students in an efficient and better way.

This application does provide the functionality to submit their assignments, view their grades.
